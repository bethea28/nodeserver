// In your index.html file you should setup three links using an a tag. The href for the first link should just be '/', the href for the second link should be '/page-2', and the href for the third link should be 'page-3'
// Copy and paste those three links into your other two html files (page-2.html and page-3.html)
// Decide on three different themes for your GIFs. Each separate HTML page should only contain GIFs for a specific theme (for example, one page can have puppy gifs, another page could have movie gifs, another page could have 90s gifs, etc.)
// Use img tags to add some gifs to each page, based on themes. Be sure to add some text to each of the links to let you know which link goes to which themes
// Setup a server in your server.js file. Setup your server so if the request url is '/', respond with your index.html file. If the request url is '/page-2', respond with your 'page-2.js' file. If the request url is '/page-3', respond with your page-3.js file
// Add some more GIFs and basic styling to your site. Remember to create a route in your server for you main.css file (in other words, make sure you have an if statement in your server that accounts for the 'main.css' url), use fs.readFile to read the contents, and write a response.
// Add 1- 2 more pages to your site with different GIF themes
